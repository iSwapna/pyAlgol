Strings Interleave 

* Wrong linear solution and (counter) Proof By Induction.





Problem Statement:

You're given three strings a, b and i. Write a function that checks whether i is an interleaving of a and b.



String i is said to be interleaving string a and b, if:
len(i) = len(a) + len(b).
i only contains characters present in a or b.
i contains all characters of a. From a, any character a[index] should be added exactly once in i.
i contains all characters of b. From b, any character b[index] should be added exactly once in i.
Order of all characters in individual strings (a and b) is preserved.

An attempt to write an O(len(i)) linear solution and then disprove it using the method of inductive proof. 
My attempt was to prove it write, but the proof lead me to the truth!
